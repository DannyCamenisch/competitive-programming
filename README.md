# Competitive Programming
Solutions to problems from various online judges / contest sites.


This repository includes solutions to both practice and contest problems from:
- Kattis ([site](https://open.kattis.com/))

Additionally this repository also includes the templates I use.

This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone may find it useful, but:
- Solutions may be broken or not work for you.
- Solutions may be illegible.
- Solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.
- Solutions may have been written in a rush during a contest and may not make any sense.

So, in summary, if a solution seems stupid, it probably is.
I do not offer support for these solutions.
I'm not interested in fixes to existing solutions or new solutions,
feel free to fork / create your own if you want to share better / other solutions.

I do try to include only working solutions (without guarantees), written by me.
When external code is used, it's usually marked as such.
If you find some borrowed code which is not properly indicated as such,
please let me know and I'll fix it.

Except for borrowed code (and whatever borrowing that code implies),
unless otherwise stated,
the code is under the _The Unlicense_,
see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

# Competitive Programming

This repository includes solutions to both practice and contest problems from:
- Kattis ([site](https://open.kattis.com/))
- Codeforces ([site](https://codeforces.com))

Additionally this repository also includes the templates I use.

This repository is personal, made public in the hope that someone may find it useful, but:
- Solutions may be broken or not work for you.
- Solutions may be illegible.
- Solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.
- Solutions may have been written in a rush during a contest and may not make any sense.

So, in summary, if a solution seems stupid, it probably is.
I do not offer support for these solutions.
I'm not interested in fixes to existing solutions or new solutions,
feel free to fork / create your own if you want to share better / other solutions.

I do try to include only working solutions (without guarantees), written by me.
